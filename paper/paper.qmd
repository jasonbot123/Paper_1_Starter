abstract: "In 2019, motor vehicle collisions accounted for 2.3% of global deaths, resulting in 1.3 million fatalities annually and approximately 3,500 deaths per day. This paper examines statistical techniques to analyze motor crash data in Toronto, using either real-world or simulated datasets, with the goal of identifying factors contributing to crashes. The data used in this study were sourced from Open Toronto, but the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data are not guaranteed, and it should not be compared with other crime data sources. Despite these limitations, the models developed in this analysis suggest that the number of accidents per year has declined over time, likely due to advancements in technology and improved public safety measures."
